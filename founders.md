How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

The founders have known one another for several years. Saleej, Abdul, and Irfan are second-time founders and were based in Chennai for many years, where they connected through startup events and early founder networks. Suhail has been closely connected with the team for nearly five years through learning circles and founder communities. These relationships later led the team to come together for the first time to build Budlee AI. All founders have met in person.

Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

All technical work on the product is done by the founders. Saleej Kuruniyan leads platform, product, and engineering, and Abdul Rahim leads AI, data, and intelligence. Suhail Mohammed leads product flow and learning experience design, based on direct student interactions and feedback that shape how the product is structured and used. No technical work has been done by non-founders. We have only taken external assistance for non-technical tasks such as branding and visual design.

Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less.

AI learning companion for school students

What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.

Budlee AI is an AI learning companion for school students (grades 6–10) that helps them understand school subjects, clear doubts while studying, practice, test their understanding, and build curiosity over time. Students learn each chapter through guided learning packs with short explanations, videos, examples, and quick practice. While studying, they can ask questions in the context of the exact chapter, and Budlee explains concepts in simple language using short videos, visuals, and syllabus-aligned examples. Budlee continuously observes what students study, ask questions about, and spend time on, and uses this to actively guide them toward subjects and topics they enjoy, helping them build real expertise from school itself. Parents can clearly see what their child understands, struggles with, and is becoming interested in.

Explain your decision regarding location.

We are based in Bangalore because our initial focus is on CBSE and the Indian school curriculum, and Bangalore gives us strong access to talent, parents, and the education ecosystem while allowing fast product iteration. The learning problems we are solving apply across major curricula, enabling expansion over time.

Progress

How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

We started working on Budlee AI in mid-2025. Since then, all founders have been working on it part-time while building the product, developing content, and validating the learning flow with students. Although none of us are full-time yet, we are consistently investing significant time each week and plan to transition as the product reaches early user adoption.

Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

We picked this idea based on our own experience as students. One of us had a strong interest in astrophysics from an early age but lacked guidance and structure to develop expertise while in school. We also observed that even academically strong students often move forward without deep understanding or clarity about what they truly want to pursue, revealing a gap between school learning and interest-driven growth. We bring domain experience from building technology products and by working directly with students while developing Budlee AI. Through repeated student interactions and feedback, we consistently saw the same problems: students memorizing instead of understanding, relying heavily on tuition to clear doubts, and having no structured way to explore their interests during school. This confirmed that the problem is real and widespread.

Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?

Our competitors include consumer learning apps focused on syllabus understanding or exam preparation, and separate platforms offering upskilling or enrichment courses. These products treat school learning, interest discovery, and skill development as separate experiences. What we understand is that students learn best through a single connected journey, where understanding concepts, practicing, testing, and exploring interests are tightly linked to what they study in school. Budlee AI bridges this gap by connecting everyday school learning with guided exploration, helping students build real expertise early instead of treating learning and upskilling as separate paths.

If you have not formed the company yet, describe the planned equity ownership breakdown among the founders, employees and any other proposed stockholders. If there are multiple founders, be sure to give the proposed equity ownership of each founder and founder title (e.g. CEO). (This question is as much for you as us.)

Accomplishments

Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.

While building Needoo, I onboarded early merchants by reframing the product not as “yet another delivery app,” but as a free digital storefront with zero setup cost that brought them incremental orders. This bypassed typical sales resistance and helped us acquire real merchants and users before we had any marketing budget

Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

Over 14+ years, I’ve shipped production systems used at scale at companies like Amazon, Intel, and Samsung, repeatedly owning critical delivery paths across backend, DevOps, and reliability. I’ve been trusted with high-impact systems where failure was not an option.

Tell us about things you've built before. For example apps you’ve built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.

I built Needoo – Your Doorstep Store, a live Android and iOS hyperlocal commerce product, taking it from idea to real users. I owned the product end-to-end: defining flows, building the backend, onboarding merchants, and shipping mobile apps that support discovery, ordering, payments, delivery tracking, and notifications. Needoo supports multi-merchant inventory, variant-level ordering, ratings, and real-time order lifecycle management. The goal was simple: help local stores compete with large marketplaces using minimal tech overhead. This project reflects my ability to identify a real-world problem, ship fast, and iterate with users. • Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.needoo.customer • iOS: https://apps.apple.com/in/app/needoo/id6503200961

When I was a kid in India, I loved playing football. One day, our football burst, and we didn't have a ball to play with. It was tough to ask our parents to buy a new one right away. Instead of giving up, I came up with a plan and shared it with my friends: we could pick raw mangoes from trees nearby and sell them at the local market. We all worked together, picked mangoes, and set up a small stand to sell them. We quickly made enough money to buy a new football. This was one of my first experiences in figuring things out on my own. It showed me how to solve problems creatively and take the lead. I learned that if you really work at it and join hands with others, you can find ways to get things done. This wasn't just about getting a new football—it was an early lesson in making things happen with what you have. This way of thinking has helped me face challenges all through my life and career.

Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

The most impressive thing I have built is my family. Leading a joint family, I have managed various needs, supported each member, and fostered happiness and peace, which has been incredibly fulfilling and challenging.

Tell us about things you've built before. For example apps you’ve built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.

I've built several impactful projects, including an AI-powered assistant that helps people summarize and understand medical reports using LLMs. Although I paused this project, it's logged as a product for Y Combinator 2024. More recently, I developed "Eco Cycle," a B2C waste management app that enables people to sell their scrap directly to recyclers via waste pickers. This project not only addresses environmental issues but also creates economic opportunities within communities.

I wanted to understand real classroom problems, but getting formal pilot access to schools takes time. Instead of waiting, I spoke directly with teachers and coordinators, focused on their day-to-day challenges rather than pitching a product, and used those conversations to validate demand and shape our approach early.

Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

I transitioned from a long-term telecom and coordination role into building and selling an early-stage education product, teaching myself software and product fundamentals while actively engaging real users to validate ideas in the market.

Accomplishments

In Procuremart, the hardest problem was not technology but user behavior. Buyers and suppliers in construction rely on phone calls and WhatsApp and do not trust new marketplaces. Instead of forcing them to change, we hacked the system by embedding ourselves into their existing flow. We replaced the “Enquire Now” buttons on supplier websites with our AI agent. Buyers felt they were contacting the supplier directly. Suppliers felt it was just a smarter inquiry tool. Behind the scenes, every request flowed through Procuremart. This avoided marketplace resistance, accelerated adoption, and gave us control of the procurement workflow without asking users to change habits.

Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

After gaining hands-on startup experience at Kadel Labs, I went on to build Procuremart, an AI-powered B2B procurement platform, which was later funded and incubated by Kadel Ventures based on early traction and execution.
